# ClusteringWebApp

The team set out to build an interactive web app to make reactive plots for geochron data in a tabular format.
The app had the power of choosing the algorithm for clustering, clustering parameters, etc. The final product has great utility in exploring geoscience data.
The product is still in its developement stage and we are working towards its functionality enhancement.
